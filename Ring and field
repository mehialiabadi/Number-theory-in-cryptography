A ring R is a set of elements with two operation (R,+,\times) with the following properteis:
- R is an abelian group under addition
- Under multiplication we have a\time b \in R
- associativity properties of R is satisfied under multiplication
there exists a muliplicative identity elemnt such that for every a \iin R a \time e=e\time a=a
