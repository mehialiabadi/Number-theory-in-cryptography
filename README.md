# Number-theory-for-cryptography


This repo includes explanation of some basic topics in number theory such as
Galois field, homomorphism and isomophism which are fundamental objects in the modern cryptography. 
It is required to be familiar with group, field and ring. If you need to refresh tou mind on these topics please see the following link: \ref link. 

Lets start with  definition of Galois field:
