# Number-theory-for-cryptography


This repo includes explanation of some basic topics in number theory such as
Galois field, homomorphism and isomophism which are fundamental objects in the modern cryptography. 
It is required to be familiar with group, field and ring. If you need to refresh tou mind on these topics please see the following link: \ref link. 

Lets start with  definition of Galois field: 
$$\\$$
Field with finite number of elements is called Galios or finitie feild  and abbreviated as (GF). 
$$Z^*_p$$,  the class of all residue where p i s prime is a galios field denoted by GF(p).

 For p=2, it's called binary field 
 Fo p>2, 
 
 
 Introduction into Polynomial
 $$\\$$
 It's possible to generate all finitie field or GF by having an irreducible polynomial.
