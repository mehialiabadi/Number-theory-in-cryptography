# Number-theory-for-cryptography

Number theory and algebra are increasingly important in computing. These concepts have been applied to fields such as cryptography and coding theory, which are impressive.

This repo includes an explanation of some basic topics in number theory such as
Galois field, homomorphism, and isomorphism are fundamental objects in modern cryptography. 

Let's start with the definition of the Galois field: 

A field with a finite number of elements is called Galios or finite field and abbreviated as (GF). 
$Z^*_p$,  the class of all residue where p is a prime number,  is a Galois field, denoted by GF(p).

 For p=2, it's called a binary field 
 Fo p>2, 
 
 
 ## Introduction to Polynomial
 It's possible to generate all finite fields or GF by having an irreducible polynomial.
