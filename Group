Group definition: 
The set H with operation o called a group if satisfys the following properties (it means that we have a function f which takes some inputs a_1,a_2,... a_n \in H, returning f(a_1,a_2,...)=a_1oa_2,...  ):
1- If a and b in H, then aob \in H. 
2- For all a , b and c in H, then we have ao(boc)=(aob)oc
3- There exists an identity element e in H such that aoe=eoa=a
4- For each element a in H, there exist an element a^{-1} in H, called inverse of a, such that aoa^{-1}=e
For example consider the set of residue integers with the addition operation(Z_{n}, +), it's a cummulative group:
