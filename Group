Group definition: 
The set H with operation o called a group if satisfys the following properties (it means that we have a function f which takes some inputs a_1,a_2,... a_n \in H, returning f(a_1,a_2,...)=a_1oa_2,...  ):
1- If a and b in H, then aob \in H. 
2- For all a , b and c in H, then we have ao(boc)=(aob)oc
3- There exists an identity element e in H such that aoe=eoa=a
4- For each element a in H, there exist an element a^{-1} in H, called inverse of a, such that aoa^{-1}=e
For example consider the set of residue integers with the addition operation(Z_{n}, +), it's a cummulative group:

- (Z,\times) is not a group ()
- (Z , -) is not a group
Definition: Abelian group: we say that a group G is abelian if for a and b in G with operation o, have: aob=boa


Abelian group example: The set Z_n * with multipication operatto (Z_n^{*} , .)

#Subgroup: consider group (R , +) the subset S of R is called subgroup iff:


Group properties:
- order of group:order of an elemnt a order(a) is  the smallest positive integer n such that aoa...oa=a^{n}=e. usaully we say the order ..
Cyclic group: it is said that G is a cyclic group if for an element a \in G with order(a)= |G| where |G|is the number of groups's elements
we could define cycling group in other word: if there exits an elemrnt g such that any number of group can be generated by g^{m} for some inetegr m:
Group elemnts: {g^0,g^1,...,g^m} for finite group and  {g^0,g^1,...,g^r,...} for infinite group.
 Note: from finite group point of view, these two definition are equal 
Note: it's clear that |G| can be either finiti or infinite.
Finite group: the group G is called finite if it has finitie  number of elements. 


Example of cyclic group: 

Generator or primitive element: an element in G with maximum order is called a generator.
