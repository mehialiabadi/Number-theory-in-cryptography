Group definition: 
The set H with operation o called a group if satisfys the following properties (it means that we have a function f which takes some inputs a_1,a_2,... a_n \in H, returning f(a_1,a_2,...)=a_1oa_2,...  ):
1- If a and b in H, then aob \in H. 
2- For all a , b and c in H, then we have ao(boc)=(aob)oc
3- There exists an identity element e in H such that aoe=eoa=a
4- For each element a in H, there exist an element a^{-1} in H, called inverse of a, such that aoa^{-1}=e
For example consider the set of residue integers with the addition operation(Z_{n}, +), it's a cummulative group:

- (Z,\times) is not a group ()
- (Z , -) is not a group
Definition: Abelian group: we say that a group G is abelian if for a and b in G with operation o, have: aob=boa


Abelian group example: The set Z_n * with multipication operatto (Z_n^{*} , .)

#Subgroup: consider group (R , +) the subset S of R is called subgroup iff:


Group properties:
- order of group: the smallest positive integer n such that aoa...oa=a^{n}=e. usaully we say the order ..
Cyclic group: it is said that G is a cyclic group if the order()= |G| where |G|is the number of groups's elements
