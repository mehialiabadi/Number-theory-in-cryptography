Group definition: 
The set H with operation o called a group if satisfys the following properties (it means that we have a function f which takes some inputs $$a_1,a_2,... a_n \in H$$, returning f(a_1,a_2,...)=a_1oa_2,...  ):
1- Closure: If a and b in H, then aob $$\in$$ H. 
2- Associativity: For all a , b and c in H, then we have ao(boc)=(aob)oc
3- There exists an identity element e in H such that aoe=eoa=a
4- For each element a in H, there exist an element $$a^{-1} \in H$$, called inverse of a, such that $$aoa^{-1}=e$$
For example consider the set of residue integers with the addition operation($$Z_{n}, +$$), it's a cummulative group:

- ($$Z,\times$$) is not a group ()
- (Z , -) is not a group
Definition: Abelian group: we say that a group G is abelian if for a and b in G with operation o, have: aob=boa


Abelian group example: The set Z_n * with multipication operatto ($$Z_n^{*} , .$$)

#Subgroup: consider group (R , +) the subset S of R is called subgroup iff:


Group properties:
- order of group:
order of an elemnt a order(a) is  the smallest positive integer n such that aoa...oa=a^{n}=e. usaully we say the order ..
Cyclic group: it is said that G is a cyclic group if for an element a \in G with order(a)= |G| where |G|is the number of groups's elements
we could define cycling group in other word: if there exits an elemrnt g such that any number of group can be generated by g^{m} for some inetegr m:
Group elemnts: {g^0,g^1,...,g^m} for finite group and  $$\{g^0,g^1,...,g^r,...\}$$ for infinite group.
 Note: from finite group point of view, these two definition are equal 
Note: it's clear that |G| can be either finiti or infinite.
Finite group: the group G is called finite if it has finitie number of elements. 


Example of cyclic group: <$$Z^*, \times_11$$> : {1,2,3,...,10}
 - |G|=10 
 - identity elemnt: e=1
 - order(2): 2.2.2.2.2= $$2^{5}.2^{5}=32.32 mode 11 = -1.-1=1 -> order(2)=10 $$
 - genertor =2

Generator or primitive element: an element in G with maximum order is called a generator.

Lagrange theorm: if G is a multiplicative group with order n ; |G|=n, then for each elemnt k in G,
we have order(k) | n.
Lagrange theorem: If G is a mulitiplactive group with order n, and H is a subgroup of G, then |H| | |G|

Imediately, it is implied that every group G with order n where n is prime is a cyclic group. Therefor, if
if p is prime, Z_p is cyclic. 

Question: for all a \in Z*_n then a^\ph(n)=1 
 proof: \ph(n)= |z*_n|=n-1 -> a^n-1=a.a.a...a=?
 
 
Fermat theorem: if p is prime and a is an integer not divisable by p, then a^{p-1} (mode p)=1,  in other word, it means that
a^{p-2}.a (mode p)=1 --> a^{p-2} is the iverse of a. 
proof: a.a....a (mode p)=(a-p)(a-p)...(a-p)
example: p=5, a=6 ,then $$6^4$$ (mode 5)=36.36 (mode 5)=1.1=1

Furthermore, it's obvios that we can deduce that for every a ,  $$a^p (mode p)=a$$

Note: Algmal crypto system is based on Z*_n, as far as I know. ($${Z^{*}}_n$$ is a cyclic group)
