In this part, we would like to have a breif introduction on Eleptic curve including its definition and
its main properties in cryptography as well. 

Definition: as the name implies, eleptic curve is a curve given with an  specific equation:
y^2=x^3+ax+b
Consider the set E of solotion to the equetion: E={(x,y): y^2=x^3+ax+b}

In order to define a group over eleptic curve, it's required to have a non-singular curve;

To define the group we need and operation o on Esuch that satifty group requirtemnets: 
Suppose define operation o: addition on ec. 

- if P and Q are two points on EC, then P+Q should be on EC.
- There exists an identity element e such that P+e=e+P=P 
- for P,Q and R , then, P+(Q+R)=(P+Q)+R
